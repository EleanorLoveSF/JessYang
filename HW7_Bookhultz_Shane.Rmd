## Libraries used

```{r echo = T, warning=FALSE}
library(foreach, warning(F))
```



## Problem 2

-Calculate sums of squares using...

```{r echo = F}

# Generating the data for problem 2

set.seed(12345)
y <- rnorm(n = 1e+07, mean = 1, sd = 1)

```

a. For loop

```{r echo = F}
#2a calculating sums of squares using a for loop, calculating the summed squared difference between data points and the mean of the data

meany <- mean(y)

SSvec <- vector()

system.time({for(i in 1:length(y)){
  SSvec[i] <- (y[i] - meany)^2
}
  Sum1 <- sum(SSvec)
})

# time for user is 3.66, system is 0.52, and elapsed is 4.32

```

b. Vector operations

```{r echo = F}
#2b Using vector operations to do the same computation

SSvec2 <- vector()

system.time({SSvec2 <- sum((y-meany)^2)})

# User is 0.05, system is 0.00, elapsed is 0.05

```

c. dopar

```{r echo = F}
#2c Use dopar to calculate sums of squares

system.time({
  ParSum <- foreach(j = 1:length(y), .combine ="+") %dopar% {
    sum((y[j]-meany)^2)
  }
})


```
d. parSapply
